<h2>Kenbak-1</h2>
<p>
  The Kenbak-1 was designed by John Blankenbaker in 1970 and first sold in early
1971.  This machine is considered to be the first "Personal Computer" according to
the Computer History Museum.  It is interesting to note that this computer predates
microprocessors (The Intel 4004 was released in 1971) and therefore it is built 
entirely from simple TTL ICs.  This machine had 256 bytes of 8-bit memory implemented
using 2 1024-bit shift registers, in essence an electronic version of the mercury
delay lines used by EDSAC and other early computers.  The machine supports 5 different
addressing modes, including indirect and indexed, a remarkable achivement for a 
machine like this.  About 40 of these machines were built and sold for around $750
each.
