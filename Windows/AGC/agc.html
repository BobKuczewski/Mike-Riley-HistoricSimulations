<h2>AGC</h2>
<p>
<h3>Apollo Guidance Computer</h3>
<p>
  This simulator is not meant to simulate the AGC as it was used on Apollo,<br>
Therefore this simulation does not include any of the other Apollo hardware<br>
that was connected to the AGC, nor does it include any of the flight software.<br>
For those interested in how the AGC was used on Apollo there is an excellent<br>
simulator (including flight software) at the Virtual AGC project:<br>
(http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/)
<p>
  The AGC was one of the earliest computers to be built using integrated<br>
circuit (IC) technology.  As a result a lot of computing power was packed<br>
into a case measuring only 24 x 12.5 x 6.5 inches, weighing around 70 pounds.<br>
The AGC consisted of 2048 words of erasable (RAM) memory and 36864 words of<br>
fixed (ROM) each of which contained 16 bits.  The AGC operated at a clock<br>
frequency of 2.048mhz.<br>
<p>
  This simulator is meant to allow you to explore how this particular computer<br>
worked and what could be done with it besides flying to the moon.  This<br>
program simulates the block II AGC as well as the DSKY that was the user<br>
interface to the AGC.  The simulator includes an integrated assembler to help<br>
the user in writing software for this machine.
