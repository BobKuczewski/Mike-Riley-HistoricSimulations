<h2>EDSAC</h2>
<p>
<h3>Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator</h3>
<p>
EDSAC was built at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory and ran<br>
its first programs on May 6, 1949.  EDSAC is considered to be the second stored<br>
program computer and is considered to be the first computer to provide a <br>
regular computing service.  When originally built EDSAC had a memory capacity<br>
of 512 18-bit words which was later expanded to 1024 words.  EDSAC had a <br>
punch tape reader for reading in programs and data and a teleprinter for<br>
output.
