<p>
<h3>Small Scale Experimental Machine</h3>
<p>
<h3>Also known as the "Manchester Baby"</h3>
<p>
The Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), also known as the Manchester<br>
Baby is widely considered to be the world's first stored program computer.<br>
Unlike The ENIAC or Z3 which used some form of mechanical storage, the <br>
SSEM stored programs and data electronically and could be changed during<br>
the course of a program run.  SSEM ran its first program on June 21, 1948.<br>
<p>
The SSEM was not intended to be a full blown computer, but rather a<br>
testbed for technologies that would be used to build the Manchester Mark I.<br>
The SSEM used the Williams tube as its means of storage.  The Williams<br>
tube was essentially a CRT with a detection grid placed in front of it. <br>
Bits of information were stored as dots on the screen that could then be<br>
detected by the grid.  A feedback circuit would read the bits off the <br>
detection grid and were used to refresh the dots on the screen, keeping<br>
them in memory.  The SSEM memory consisted of 32 words of 32 bits each.<br>
<p>
The SSEM understood 7 different instructions and despite this small<br>
instruction set and only 32 words of storage many interesting program had<br>
been written for it.
