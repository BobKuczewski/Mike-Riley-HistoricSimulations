<h3><b>Using the High-Speed Multiplier</b></h3>
<p>
In the last tutorial we setup the High-Speed Multiplier for use, now we will actually use it to<br>
multiply some numbers.  Up until now we have used the Constant Transmitter to provide our values<br>
that we have been using in past tutorials.  In this tutorial I am going to also introduce how to<br>
use the Card Reader to provide values for your setups.
<p>
Be sure to start this tutorial using the saved setup from the last tutorial.  This tutorial assumes<br>
that the High-Speed Multiplier is already properly connected.
<p>
<table width="100%" cols=2 border=0>
  <tr>
    <td width=200><img src="Images/InitTab.jpg"></td>
    <td>First be sure you have the <b>Init</b> tab slected on the simulator</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/Reader_output_P1-A2.jpg"></td>
    <td>Set the output of the Reader to <b>P1-A:2</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
We will be using the <b>Start</b> button to start this setup rather than the <b>Go</b> button that<br>
we have been using in the past. When using the <b>Start</b> button the first action of ENIAC is to<br>
read a card and then once the read is complete to send a pulse on the Reader ouptut.
<p>
We are going to allow this setup to process multiple cards, so will instruct ENIAC to read the next<br>
card immediately upon completion of the first read.
<p>
<table width="100%" cols=2 border=0>
  <tr>
    <td width=200><img src="Images/Reader_input_P1-A2_output_P1-A2.jpg"></td>
    <td>Set the input of the Reader to <b>P1-A:2</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
At this point you might be wondering why we immediatly begin reading the next card before processing<br>
the first card.  The reason we can do this is because ENIAC takes quite a bit of time to actually<br>
read a card.  While ENIAC is reading the next card we can do the remainder of the work and therefore<br>
wait a little bit less time during the next loop.  In order to prevent the reader from sending its<br>
output pulse too early there is an interlock input to prevent the Reader from outputting a pulse<br>
until the interlock has received a pulse.  If the Reader finishes before it receives the interlock<br>
pulse, then it just waits until it receives the pulse before sending the next output pulse.

  <tr>
    <td width=200><img src="Images/Reader_IL_P1-A1.jpg"></td>
    <td>Set the Reader Interlock to <b>P1-A:1</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Now lets go and put some cards in the reader
<p>
<table width="100%" cols=2 border=0>
  <tr>
    <td width=200><img src="Images/ReaderTab.jpg"></td>
    <td>Select the <b>Reader</b> tab</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/PowerOn.jpg"></td>
    <td>Turn <b>On</b> the power to the card reader</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Enter the following two cards into the Card Input Hopper:
<p>
<img src="Images/Tutorial6_cards.jpg">
<p>
In past tutorials we have punched cards, but I have not really gone over the format itself on punched<br>
cards.  A punched card contains 80 columns, divided into 8 fields of 10 digits, or more precisely<br>
16 fields of 5 digits each.  When a card is read, each group of 10 digits is placed into one of the<br>
Constant Tramistter registers, Registers A through H.  The + and - signs that appear on cards on the<br>
original ENIAC were over-punches that occured on one of the digits in the field, it did not matter<br>
which character the overpunches occured on, so for example, all of these are valid ways to punch<br>
-123:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>-0000000123
  <li>0000000-123
  <li>000000012-3
</ul>
Note that 0000000123- is not a valid way to punch -123 since the - sign will belong to the next field,<br>
leaving the number as +123.  If no sign appears at all in the field, the resulting number is positive.<br>
Each of the two 5 digit numbers in each field can have its own sign.  For example:
<p>
+00123-00123
<p>
If no sign appears in the second half of a 10 digit group, then the sign of the second half will be<br>
the same as the first half. For example:
<p>
-0012300456
<p>
Would be -123 and -456.
<p>
Here is the format indicating how each digit is placed into the Constant Transmitter registers:
<p>
+AAAAA+AAAAA+BBBBB+BBBBB+CCCCC+CCCCC+DDDDD+DDDDD+EEEEE+EEEEE+FFFFF+FFFFF+GGGGG+GGGGG+HHHHH+HHHHH
<p>
Now, lets get back to creating our setup. When we left off, after a card was read the Card Reader<br>
sent a P1-A:2 pulse. We now need to act on that pulse.
<p>
<table width="100%" cols=2 border=0>
  <tr>
    <td width=200><img src="Images/Const1Tab.jpg"></td>
    <td>Select the <b>Const1</b> tab</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/PowerOn.jpg"></td>
    <td>Turn <b>On</b> the power to the Constant Transmitter</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/IO1_input_P1-A2.jpg"></td>
    <td>Set the input for program 1 to <b>P1-A:2</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/Const_Prog1_LR_A.jpg"></td>
    <td>Configure program 1 by setting its mode to <b>LR</b> and to send register <b>A</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/A_D1-A.jpg"></td>
    <td>Set the digit output of the Constant Transmitter to <b>D1-A</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Now we need to configure accumulator 1 to receive the first number
<p>
<table width="100%" cols=2 border=0>
  <tr>
    <td width=200><img src="Images/AccTab.jpg"></td>
    <td>Select the <b>Acc</b> tab</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/Accumulator1.jpg"></td>
    <td>Select accumulator <b>1</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/PowerOn.jpg"></td>
    <td>Turn <b>On</b> the power to this accumulator</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/I1_P1-A2.jpg"></td>
    <td>Set the input for program 1 to <b>P1-A:2</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/AccProg1_alpha_0.jpg"></td>
    <td>Configure program 1 by setting its mode to <b>alpha</b> and its Clear/Correct switch to <b>0</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/Alpha_D1-A.jpg"></td>
    <td>Set the alpha digit input port to <b>D1-A</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Now we need to retrieve the second value into accumulator 2
<p>
<table width="100%" cols=2 border=0>
  <tr>
    <td width=200><img src="Images/Const1Tab.jpg"></td>
    <td>Select the <b>Const1</b> tab</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/IO1_input_P1-A2_output_P1-A3.jpg"></td>
    <td>Set the output for program 1 to <b>P1-A:3</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/IO2_input_P1-A3.jpg"></td>
    <td>Set the input for program 2 to <b>P1-A:3</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/Const_Prog2_LR_B.jpg"></td>
    <td>Configure program 2 by setting its mode to <b>LR</b> and to send register <b>B</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/AccTab.jpg"></td>
    <td>Select the <b>Acc</b> tab</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/Accumulator2.jpg"></td>
    <td>Select accumulator <b>2</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/PowerOn.jpg"></td>
    <td>Turn <b>On</b> the power to this accumulator</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/I1_P1-A3.jpg"></td>
    <td>Set the input for program 1 to <b>P1-A:3</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/AccProg1_alpha_0.jpg"></td>
    <td>Configure program 1 by setting its mode to <b>alpha</b> and its Clear/Correct switch to <b>0</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/Alpha_D1-A.jpg"></td>
    <td>Set the alpha digit input port to <b>D1-A</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Now that we have the numbers to multiply, we can trigger the multiply action
<p>
<table width="100%" cols=2 border=0>
  <tr>
    <td width=200><img src="Images/Const1Tab.jpg"></td>
    <td>Select the <b>Const1</b> tab</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/IO2_input_P1-A3_output_P1-A4.jpg"></td>
    <td>Set the output for program 2 to <b>P1-A:4</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/MultiplierTab.jpg"></td>
    <td>Select the <b>Multiplier</b> tab</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/IO1_input_P1-A4.jpg"></td>
    <td>Set the input for program 1 to <b>P1-A:4</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Next we have to configure all the parameters of the multiplier program
<p>
<table width="100%" cols=2 border=0>
  <tr>
    <td width=200><img src="Images/Ier1_alpha_C.jpg"></td>
    <td>Configure the Ier1 selector to <b>alpha</b> and the Ier Clear switch to <b>C</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
The purpose of the Ier control switches is to control how the multiplier accumulator (9) receives its<br>
argument.  When the mode switch is set at any of the values from alpha to epsilon, a pulse will be<br>
sent on the R alpha through R epsilon outputs corresponding to the mode setting.  In the case above,<br>
mode alpha is selected, so a pulse will be sent out the R alpha program output, which is connected<br>
to a program on accumulator 9 setup to receive on the alpha channel.  The Ier Clear switch specifies<br>
what will happen to the accumulator once multiplication is complete.  If the switch is set to C then<br>
the accumulator will be cleared to zeroes upon completion, otherwise it will be left intact.
<p>
<table width="100%" cols=2 border=0>
  <tr>
    <td width=200><img src="Images/Icand1_beta_C.jpg"></td>
    <td>Configure the Icand1 selector to <b>beta</b> and the Ier Clear switch to <b>C</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
The Icand control switches work just like the Ier control switches, except they control the multiplicand<br>
accumulator (10).  Also, the pulse receive pulse will be sent on the D alpha through D epsilon program<br>
output.
<p>
<table width="100%" cols=2 border=0>
  <tr>
    <td width=200><img src="Images/Figures1_Off.jpg"></td>
    <td>Set the Figures 1 control switch to <b>Off</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
The figures control switch controls round-off in the answer.  Since we are producing a full 20 digit<br>
product, we do not want round off to occur.  Normally if this switch is set from 2 through 10 it will<br>
place a 5 in the digit position one greater than the setting of the switch.
<p>
<table width="100%" cols=2 border=0>
  <tr>
    <td width=200><img src="Images/Places1_10.jpg"></td>
    <td>Set the Places 1 switch to <b>10</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
The Places switch specifies how many digits (counting from the left) of the multiplier (accumulator 9)<br>
are used for the multiplication.  All 10 digits of the multiplicand (accumulator 10) are always used.<br>
For example: If the multiplier accumulator held +1257500000 and the Places switch was set to 3 then<br>
then all 10 digits of the multiplicand will be multipled by just .125.
<p>
<table width="100%" cols=2 border=0>
  <tr>
    <td width=200><img src="Images/Product1_AC.jpg"></td>
    <td>Set the Product 1 switch to <b>AC</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
This final program setting switch controlls the final product accumulators (13 and 14) and specifies<bR>
what they are to do when multiplication is complete. The setting of this switch specifies which of the<br>
A through ASC program outputs on panel 3 will be pulsed when multiplication is done.  Normally these<br>
are connected to the product accumulator (13) and activate send programs to send the final product<br>
to another destionation.
<p>
This completes the setup of the multiplication program.  Now we need to set accumulators 1 and 2, which<br>
hold the values we read from the card, to send their values to the multiplier and multiplicand <br>
accumulators at the same time as when the Multiplier Unit is triggered
