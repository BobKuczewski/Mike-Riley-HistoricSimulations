<h2>ENIAC</h2>
<p>
<h3>Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer</h3>
<p>
ENIAC was completed in February of 1946 and is widely considered to be the first<br>
general purpose electronic computer.  Although there were numerous computing machines<br>
that predate ENIAC, most of them were mechanical or electro-mechanical in nature and<br>
none of them were considered general purpose.
<p>
The construction of ENIAC used 17,468 vacuum tubes, 7,200 diodes, 1,500 relays,<br>
70,000 resisters, 10,000 capicitors and some 5 million solder joints.  ENIAC weighed<br>
approximately 27 tons, took up around 1,800 square feet of floor space and consumed<br>
about 150kw of power to run.
<p>
ENIAC consisted of 32 units spread accross 40 panels and was programmed by setting<br>
its thousands of switches spread across its units and then cabling its units together<br>
to perform complex calculations
<p>

<h3>The Simulator</h3>
<p>
This ENIAC simulation simulates the majority of the original ENIAC machine.  The following
units are simulated:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Initiating Unit
  <li>Cycling Unit
  <li>Master Programmer
  <li>20 Accumulators
  <li>High Speed Multiplier
  <li>Divider/Square Rooter
  <li>3 Function Tables
  <li>Constant Transmitter
  <li>Card Reader
  <li>Card Punch
</ul>
<p>
All units are 100% simulated with the execption of the card reader and card punch.
In the case of the card reader and punch the plugboard<br> associated with these two
units has not yet been simulated.  Once I have them fully figured out they will
be implemented in a future version.

<h3>Additional Programs</h3>
<p>
<h4>Mandelbrot Set Plotter</h4>
<p>
This setup allows the ENIAC to plot the Mandelbrot set on the card punch.  Initially<br>
the initial setup plots the entire set.  It is possible to plot a subset by changing<br>
the startup and increment values.  A text file is included to help explain how this<br>
setup functions.

<h4>PI</h4>
<p>
This is a simple setup to compute the value of PI.  It does this using the 1-1/3+1/5...<br>
method.  This is not the most efficient way to compute PI, but is simpler to understand<br>

<h4>Logic</h4>
<p>
ENIAC was originally programed by setting the thousands of switches on its various units<br>
and then cabling them together to perform sequences.  Some time in 1948 ENIAC was <br>
permanently wired to act more like a stored-program computer.  After this wiring ENIAC<br>
executed programs off of its function tables.  Now programming took mere hours instead<br>
of weeks.  I have very little information on how this was done but was intrigued by<br>
this change.  I decided to attempt to create such a stored-program computer using only<br>
the original ENIAC hardware.  This setup is my attempt.

<h4>99 Bottles</h4>
<p>
I saw on a website (<a href="http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/"> http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/</a>)
a program for doing the 99 bottles<br>
of bear song on the ENIAC.  The program was written in an assembly language which means<br>
it was not for the original hardware-programming model, and after examination of the<br>
program and what I do know of the stored-program concept of the modifified ENIAC, I<br>
am not quite sure this program was for the actual ENIAC.  However, I was intrigued<br>
by the method the guy used and so I produced this setup to punch out the lyrics of<br>
the song.  Since ENIAC only worked in numbers the ASCII numbers are punched onto <br>
cards to output the song.  A sample c program is included that can read the punch card<br>
output and convert the codes back to ascii.
