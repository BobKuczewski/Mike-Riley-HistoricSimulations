<h2>KIM I</h2>
<p>
  The KIM I was created by MOS Technology, Inc. as a single board computer to
help developers get to know their new 6502 microprocessor.  This little computer
also became popular with hobbyists of the era for its low price ($295) and the
fact that it was already assembled and ready to run.
<p>
  The KIM I in its base configuration contained 1k of RAM, 2k of ROM which held
its simple monitor program and 2 IO/Timer chips.  The main board contained memory
decoding for adding up to 5k of memory.  Expansion up to the full 64k of the 6502
was possible using external decoding.
